#We make containers to store data in python 


a = 1                               #a is a variable, quite simple

There are 4 types of data types:
a = 1                   numeric datatype, includes: int, Float, complex
b = True                Boolean datatype..
c = "Something"         Text datatype
d = None

                        Sequential datatype : list, tuples(Lists can be changed but tuples cannot be changed)
                        Mapped datatype : dict

#To find the type of data type of variable
print("The data type of a is ", type(a))
print("The data type of b is ", type(b))
print("The data type of c is ", type(c))
print("The data type of d is ", type(d))
