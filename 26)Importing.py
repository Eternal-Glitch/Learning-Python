#We use import to use libraries and its functions in our code

import math
# import math as m  => m.sqrt() * m.pi           => m is like an object now, you use it to call math functions
# from math import sqrt,pi                       => We only importing 2 functions here
# from math import *                             => We importing everything
# from math import sqrt as s,pi  => s(4) * pi    => We made object for sqrt, so to use it we just write s

result = math.sqrt(4) * math.pi
print(result)
print(dir.math)     #dir is a function, this will show all the functions inside of math 

from EncryptDecrypt import *        #This will import the everything from the file you have
#It's better to not have numbers at the start in file name, nor spaces
